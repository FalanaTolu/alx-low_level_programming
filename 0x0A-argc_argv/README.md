# Documentation for Project 0x0A-argc_argv

**This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects**



This project was mainly about working with the *argc* and *argv* arguments to *main* in C programming language. It showed how to use arguments passed to your program, what the two prototypes of main are, and in which situations to use them.


It also showed how to use *__attribute__((unused))* or *(void)* to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.
