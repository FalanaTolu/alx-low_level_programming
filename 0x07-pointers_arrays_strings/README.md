# Documentation for Project 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

**This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects**



This project continued from where Project 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings stopped.


It explained what pointers to pointers are and how to use them, what multidimensional arrays are and how to use them and touched on some of the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings.
