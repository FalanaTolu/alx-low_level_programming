# Documentation for Project 0x01-hello_world



**This file is mandatory in all ALX School projects**



This project was an introduction to the fundamentals of C programming.



It discussed the importance of *C* programming language and why it is still relevant today and the invention of *C* by Dennis Ritchie. It also explained who Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds were.



It examined *C* as a high-level language and looked at the processes involved in the compilation of a source code till it becomes an executable file. It showed how to compile using *gcc* and what the default program name is when compiling with *gcc*.



It explained what happens when you type *gcc main.c*, what an entry point is, what *main* is, how to print text using *printf, puts and putchar*, how to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator *sizeof*.
 


It also demonstrated the official *C* coding style and how to check your code with betty-style. It illustrated how to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function and  explained how the *main* function influences the return value of the program.
